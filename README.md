# AE Scriptbox

A dockable CEP extension for Adobe After Effects aiming to simplify your usage of scripts.  
Works for version 22 or newer.

## What exactly is this for?

### Scriptbox panel

Usage of scripts in AE can be a big time saver. However, the experience of running said script can be quite annoying, especially if you have lots of them installed. 

This extension allows you to have a dockable panel with buttons to run those scripts. It makes using even the simplest scripts an actual QoL AE feature and not just an annoyance. 

- Show only the scripts you want to use through settings
- Settings are saved locally
- Uses Gridstack.js to customize the layout of the buttons

### Jsx scripts

The repository includes the scripts I wrote for myself to simplify my own workflow. You can download and install them as well, but I recommend looking around for scripts that will actually help you.

There are many different collections of simple scripts such as https://github.com/kyletmartinez/after-effects-scripts
